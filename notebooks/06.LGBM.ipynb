    "The learning curve shows a steady decline in log loss for both the training and validation datasets across boosting iterations. Initially, the log loss decreases rapidly, reflecting significant improvements in model performance. After approximately 30 iterations, the validation loss begins to stabilize, suggesting the model is approaching its optimal performance. The validation and training curves remain closely aligned throughout the iterations, indicating minimal overfitting. Early stopping was applied at 50 iterations when no further improvements in validation loss were observed, ensuring a balanced and well-generalized model."

    "Following feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the model demonstrates a balanced performance between precision and recall, particularly for subscribers (\"Yes\"). The overall accuracy stands at 89%, showcasing the model's robustness despite the class imbalance. The precision for \"Yes\" is 51%, indicating moderate confidence in the model's predictions for subscribers, though false positives are present. The recall for \"Yes\" is 75%, showing that the model effectively identifies the majority of actual subscribers, which is crucial for targeting valuable leads. For non-subscribers (\"No\"), the model performs exceptionally well, achieving a precision of 96% and a recall of 90%, ensuring most non-subscribers are correctly classified. The AUC score highlights the model's strong ability to differentiate between the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning curve further emphasizes that the model trains effectively. Training loss steadily decreases, reflecting consistent performance improvement. Validation loss initially follows the same trend but stabilizes around iteration 50, where early stopping is applied to mitigate overfitting. This approach ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data, balancing performance on both training and validation sets. While the model excels in identifying non-subscribers, improving precision for subscribers remains an important focus to reduce false positives and enhance overall campaign efficiency."
