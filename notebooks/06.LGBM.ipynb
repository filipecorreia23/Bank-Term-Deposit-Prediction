    "The learning curve shows the model's performance across boosting iterations. The training log loss (blue line) consistently decreases as boosting progresses, indicating that the model is effectively learning from the training data. However, the validation log loss (orange line) flattens and begins to slightly increase around iteration 50, signaling the onset of overfitting. Early stopping was triggered to prevent further overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data while maintaining a balance between training and validation performance. This highlights the effectiveness of early stopping in controlling model complexity"

    "Following feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the model achieves a balanced performance between precision and recall, particularly for subscribers (\"Yes\"). The overall accuracy remains strong at 91%, demonstrating the model's robustness despite the class imbalance. The precision for \"Yes\" is 62%, meaning the model is moderately confident in its predictions for subscribers, though some false positives are present. The recall for \"Yes\" is 50%, indicating that the model identified half of the actual subscribers, which is moderate. For non-subscribers (\"No\"), the model performs exceptionally well, achieving a precision of 94% and a recall of 96%, ensuring most non-subscribers are correctly classified. The AUC score of 0.926 further highlights the model's ability to differentiate between the two classes effectively. While the model excels in identifying non-subscribers, improving recall for subscribers remains critical to enhance the overall campaign impact and capture more valuable leads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the learning curve illustrates that the model trains effectively, with training loss consistently decreasing. Validation loss initially follows a similar trend but stabilizes and slightly increases around iteration 50, indicating the onset of overfitting. The use of early stopping successfully mitigates this issue, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data. While the model excels in identifying non-subscribers, improving recall for subscribers remains critical to enhance the overall campaign impact and capture more valuable leads.\n",
