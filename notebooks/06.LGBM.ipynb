    "Following feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the model achieves a balanced performance between precision and recall, particularly for subscribers (\"Yes\"). The overall accuracy remains strong at 91%, demonstrating the model's robustness despite the class imbalance. The precision for \"Yes\" is 64%, meaning the model is moderately confident in its predictions for subscribers, though some false positives are present. The recall for \"Yes\" is 50%, indicating that the model identified half of the actual subscribers, which is moderate. For non-subscribers (\"No\"), the model performs exceptionally well, achieving a precision of 94% and a recall of 96%, ensuring most non-subscribers are correctly classified. The AUC score of 0.9265 further highlights the model's ability to differentiate between the two classes effectively. While the model excels in identifying non-subscribers, improving recall for subscribers remains critical to enhance the overall campaign impact and capture more valuable leads.\n",
